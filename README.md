FREE BBS DOOR PRODUCTS
All Sunrise BBS Door Software products have now been released as Donationware.

For those unfamiliar with this concept, Donationware is a licensing model that supplies fully operational unrestricted software (in our case, after completing a registration form and then receiving the registration number) to the user and requests an optional donation. We would appreciate a donation to our Coffee Fund, perhaps commensurate with the number of free product registrations you receive.

To avoid any confusion the following 'rules of the road' apply:

Priority, both with filling free registration requests and responding to support requests, is afforded to Coffee Fund donators first.
You must complete the Free Products Registration Form. Any missing or incomplete fields will result in the form being rejected and you having to complete a new one. So please review everything carefully before submitting!
We issue registration codes as a group, ie: ALL product codes and not individual product codes. If you have registered any or all the products previously they and the rest of the products will be processed for a nominal fee as described here.
Registration forms will be processed in the order they have been received (including re-submitted forms).
Registration information will be sent to the Email address supplied in the form. If you do not receive an Email check your spam/junk folder. We would suggest that you white list sunrisedoors.com!
Free registration codes are issued ONCE for each customer.
You will be subscribed to our notification-only Mailing List
Lost registration numbers will be replaced as described in our then published POLICIES
Changes requested for previously registered products will be processed as described in our then published POLICIES

Once registered, your products are eligible to participate in the InterBBS Competition. A nominal yearly participation fee applies. ONE fee covers all your registered competition-eligible products. Check the Competition tab in the main menu at the top of the page for more information!
Sunrise Door Software reserves the right to deny individual requests for a FREE registration, at their sole discretion.
Updated! If you do not receive a response from us within 72 hours, please open a SUPPORT TICKET to let us know. Requests for a re-send of registration/activation codes, past the 72 hours window, will require a nominal fee as described here.
